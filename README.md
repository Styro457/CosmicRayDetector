# Cosmic Ray Detector

This program was initially created for the [Qube2Space](https://students.2space.ro/qube2space) contest. 

It **analyzes the frames of a video** taken with a **blacked out CMOS camera sensor** and detects cosmic rays that hit the sensor.

Because of the short life span of these particles, only a small precentage reach the earths surface: <br>
aproximately 1 muon per minute per cm<sup>3</sup>.

The brightness and frequency of each pixel is taken into consideretion in order to minimize the errors caused by malfunctions in the sensor such as hot pixels.
For the best results, the video should be saved in RAW format.
